# simple-fisheye-radial-correction
I wanted/needed a simple way of correcting images from my 220degree fisheye on the ESP32 cam module.
I didn't find a suitable solution online so I came up with my own. 

Doing this directly on the esp32 was going to be annoying so I made a python script to help me with testing the code and parameters. While the code worked mostly as intended, Finding the right parameters was not easy and I needed a more graphical aproach. I wanted to make it easily accessible both for my sake and for the sake of others searching for a similar solution, so I decided to implement it in javascript.
